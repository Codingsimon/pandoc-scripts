## Pandoc automated document converter
A tool for converting markdown files to pdf and docx by using pandoc. The tool is highly cutomisable and creates out of multible files a complete book with a table of content and chapters. Shell scripts are used for controlling the conversion process with pandoc. Environment variables as settings for the markdown files are read in by a shellscript. This tool can be automated by using a Pandoc Docker image and Gitlab CI/CD.
