## Pandoc automated document converter
A tool for converting markdown files to pdf and docx by using pandoc. The tool is highly customisable and creates out of multible files a complete book document with a table of content and chapters. Shell scripts are used for controlling the conversion process with pandoc. Environment variables as settings for the markdown files are read in by a shellscript. This tool can be automated by using a Pandoc [Docker image](https://github.com/Pawedla/pandoc-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) and Gitlab CI/CD.

The tool is based on [@tfragners pandoc-scripts](https://github.com/tfragner/pandoc-scripts)
